I’m a 4th-year Accounting Ph.D. candidate at The University of Melbourne. My primary research interest lies in disclosure regulations, especially environmental regulatory disclosure. I study firms' disclosure behaviors in regulatory settings and aim to understand the challenges associated with environmental disclosure. 

I have a particular interest in the oil and gas sector.  My job market paper studies fracking firms' disclosure decisions in a mandatory chemical disclosure regime where regulators allow firms to withhold pollutant information regarded as a trade secret. I also use advanced technologies (i.e., remote sensing satellites) to examine environmental misreporting in the oil and gas sector.  My ongoing project explores how mandatory disclosure regulations affect firms' pollution and production allocation within the internal network. 

Aside from disclosure regulations, I also study management control practices. I use archival data to answer management control questions in the education sector.  My work has been published in Accounting, Organizations and Society. 

I obtained my master's degree in Accounting from The University of Melbourne and a bachelor's degree in Journalism from Tsinghua University (Beijing). Prior to entering the doctoral program, I worked as an auditor at PwC (Beijing office). I have also been a CSR consultant at Bayer China. 

I will be on the job market in Autumn 2023.
